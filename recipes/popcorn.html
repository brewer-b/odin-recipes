        <li>6 quarts popped popcorn</li>
        <li>2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup light corn syrup</li>
        <li>⅔ cup butter</li>
        <li>2 (.13 ounce) envelopes unsweetened soft drink mix,

        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). 
            Grease a large baking sheet. Place popped popcorn in a large bowl. </li>
        <li> Combine sugar, corn syrup, and butter in a saucepan; 
            bring to a boil until sugar dissolves, about 3 minutes. </li>
        <li> Combine drink mix and baking soda in a large bowl;
             pour sugar mixture into drink mixture, stirring carefully. 
             Sugar mixture will bubble. Pour mixture over popcorn;
             toss to evenly coat. Transfer coated popcorn to baking sheet. </li>
        <li> Bake in the preheated oven, stirring every 10 minutes, 
            until coating has hardened, about 30 minutes.

    </ol>
