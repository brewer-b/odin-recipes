    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This basic chicken salad is a family favorite. 
        I like to use baked thighs or breasts that have been sprinkled with basil or rosemary.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup blanched slivered almonds</li>
        <li>½ cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped, cooked chicken meat</li>
        <li>1 stalk celery, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place almonds in a frying pan. Toast over medium-high heat, shaking frequently. 
            Watch carefully, as they burn easily.  </li>
        <li>Mix together mayonnaise, lemon juice, and pepper in a medium bowl.
            Toss with chicken, toasted almonds, and celery. </li>
    </ol>
